- [x] Interactive Drag & Drop outlets to bias
- [ ] Allow re-drag & drop
- [ ] Show & Compare to actual data
- [x] Animate CONTINUE call to action
- [ ] The interactive tutorial (can just be an animated image)
- [x] Highlight user's current sources. Show score. Suggest other sources.
- [x] Learn:

  - [ ] Primary sources are always the best
  - [ ] Make up your own mind first
  - [ ] Acknowledge your bias (and the source's bias)
  - [ ] Vary your media diet
